  # Image classification
  You need to understand how to build image recognition and object detection models with deep neural
  networks and convolutional neural networks using TensorFlow 2.x. You need to know how to:
  
:heavy_check_mark: Define Convolutional neural networks with Conv2D and pooling layers.
  
:heavy_check_mark: Build and train models to process real-world image datasets.
  
:heavy_check_mark: Understand how to use convolutions to improve your neural network.
  
:heavy_check_mark: Use real-world images in different shapes and sizes..
  
:heavy_check_mark: Use image augmentation to prevent overfitting.
  
:heavy_check_mark: Use ImageDataGenerator.
  
:heavy_check_mark: Understand how ImageDataGenerator labels images based on the directory structure.
